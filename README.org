#+TITLE: Sovol SV-02 Profiles for PrusaSlicer/slic3r/SuperSlicer
[[file:Sovol/SV-02_thumbnail.png]]

** THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK ON THIS andrewsuzuki!

This is a simple adaptation of the Creality Ender profiles for the Sovol SV-02.

Copy to your machine, then they will be available in PrusaSlicer as presets with nice thumbnail images.

Thanks to just_trey for the platform texture and for turning Elegoo's cad files into a nice stl.

** Installation

1. Close PrusaSlicer.
2. Copy =Sovol.ini=, =Sovol.idx=, and the =Sovol= directory to your PrusaSlicer vendor directory. On MacOS this will be in =~/Library/Application\ Support/PrusaSlicer/vendor=, on Windows this will be =C:\users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\PrusaSlicer\vendor=.
3. Open PrusaSlicer and add printers (Gear icon -> Add/Remove Presets -> Other Vendors -> Check Sovol -> Click Sovol FFF -> Click checkbox -> Filaments -> Finish).

** Modifications/Notes

- Configured printable area is 280mm x 230mm. This is to avoid the binder clips that come stock. If you've fitted a magnetic sheet without binder clips, you can increase the configured area to 280mm x 240mm.
- All filament temperatures and settings are the same as the Creality Ender 3.
